375,snowboarding,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

698,snowboarding,"Went snowboarding up at Mont Tremblant this past weekend. While I don‚Äôt recall anything specific happening, it looks like I clipped something under powder in the woods that took a decent little chunk off the top sheet of my new Arbor Annex board.

There‚Äôs a fiber stringer that‚Äôs flapping in the breeze now, and looks like the ash wood core underneath is exposed. No apparent damage to the black sidewall or edge, surprisingly.

Not super concerned about the cosmetics, fully aware that snowboards are meant to be ridden and will take bumps and scrapes in the name of having fun over time. 

My main concern is that I want to prevent any long term water damage to the wood core, which I assume means sealing the exposed area with some resin or epoxy.

761,snowboarding,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

1109,snowboarding,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

- I can do flat ground bs360 but feel like I‚Äôm stalling in the air on my 180s. Probably should whip my shoulders / head around quicker? 
-I scrub the landing and it seems like I‚Äôm leaning forward a bit on the take off? 
- I‚Äôm popping and then twisting on take off. Seems to be okay for 180 but feel like this might be a bad habit if I want to throw 360s. 

Any other feedback / exercises would be greatly appreciated!",BS 180 Improvement &gt; BS360.

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

1901,snowboarding,"Hi,
So for a couple of years now, I've been struggling to find a board that suits me, there's always a trade-off with the last board I had before.

I don't ride park. I only ride in the French alps, so all my board needs to be able to do is carve, be quick edge to edge and moguls. 

Last year I bought a Bataleon Chaser 159, awesome on moguls and super quick to throw around edge to edge, but the carving capabilities were limited.

This year I got a Salomon dancehaul 152, great board overal. Carving and non bumpy slopes were awesome. But a real workout on moguls. 

Now this had me thinking. What board would be able to do both?

I was thinking a Bataleon Party Wave as it had the 3bt so I can throw it around while wide enough to be able to do some deep carves?

Does anyone know if this is a valid idea or any board that would suit both the carve and mogul slopes?

Thanks!!",Carving-Mogul board?

To fix this issue I am looking for the little X shaped apparatus that goes on top of the foot and connects the two separate ratchets. I don't need any other pieces, just that thing. I don't know what it's called and have had no luck finding anything close. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!!

2294,snowboarding,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

We havent had real snow where i live for a while, only getting some practice when we went up north. Made her our own hill and she did pretty well. 

I am assuming this board is good for slowing her down when needed, but after more research realized that nobody really uses these boards with holes.

I am wondering a couple things. Is it worth it to bring this board to a real hill to learn (bunny hills). Also, should these be waxed too?  Likely will get a proper board next year.

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

Here are some great free YouTube resources for tips.

Trying to find out if this snowboard is real before I spend a few hundred bucks on it. 

I rented this snowboard from Blue Mountain and loved it so I‚Äôm trying to buy it new on eBay. 

The only difference I see between the one I rented, and the one that I want to buy, is that the barcode number is different. 

Anyone have any idea if that could mean it‚Äôs fake? I‚Äôm still pretty new to snowboarding so I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to tell. I would buy it from Burton directly but it seems like they don‚Äôt make it anymore.

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

I'm going snowboarding in January and instead of renting I was thinking of taking my old board but I'm not sure if it is good enough or if it would ruin my experience because it's so old (about 14 years old).

Its appears to have lost most of its camber as well to untrained eye, with it being around 3-4 mm of the ground when laid flat. It's been a while since I paid attention to this stuff so I wasn't sure if that's acceptable?

A little bit about my experience/skill level in case that's relevant. I've been sbowboarsing around 5 or 6 times l, for a week each time, and I ride on piste primarily with a bit of off piste and pretty much never go in the park. I don't know if that makes a difference.

I'm mainly just wondering if my board is dead and needs replacing?

Or would it just be worth renting a snowboard?

I‚Äôve only been skiing about ten times since 2002 with most of that in the past four years. 

I blew my ACL again earlier this year and had surgery again. I‚Äôm cleared for skiing/snowboarding. Leaving tomorrow to go for three days with kiddo. 

My board is a ~1997 WFO and I think it‚Äôs a 162cm.  If I get some wax on it, is there any reason I can‚Äôt use it?  (I have bought new boots since my old ones had actually disintegrated with age).

4433,snowboarding,"Hi,

I have knock knees, basically my knees cave in and my arches collapse inward.

I tried skiing first for 2 seasons but I could never get to parallel skis and would get knee pain from poor form, so I switched to snowboarding which has been better on the knees/skills.

I‚Äôve been snowboarding for 3 seasons only about 3 days/season. I can safely make it down a moderate blue without issues usually. The biggest issue I run into is consistently carving without tiring out on steep terrain.

I work out lifting/stretching/cardio 4 days a week and always try to continue stretching for improved ankle mobility and strengthened hip flexors, but I‚Äôd say they are still not super strong even with all the hip/ankle exercises I‚Äôve followed for years.

Do you have any recommendations for snowboard adjustments with knock knees? I usually just have the rental place set my board for what they recommend/‚Äústandard‚Äù, but I‚Äôm wondering if any additional adjustments could help with easier carving related to the knock knees and weakish ankle/hip mobility?

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 170 lbs, ride with rental boards (whatever the shop recommends), and I think the knock knees is genetic bc my sisters have it too.

Thanks",Knock knees and board adjustments

These blew everything out of the water (gordini cirque 3 finger was a solid second place). Tried and true hestra leather with a waterproof layer. 5 finger insulation makes you feel like you‚Äôre still wearing normal gloves, except with the added warmth, mobility and padding for hard falls. Only drawback is price and sizing. I wear a 10 in all other hestra lines so I ordered these in 11 and they feel molded specifically to my hand.

The only clues I have are the names on the board (ignore the stickers):
