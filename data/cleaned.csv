375,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

698,1,"Went snowboarding up at Mont Tremblant this past weekend. While I don‚Äôt recall anything specific happening, it looks like I clipped something under powder in the woods that took a decent little chunk off the top sheet of my new Arbor Annex board.

There‚Äôs a fiber stringer that‚Äôs flapping in the breeze now, and looks like the ash wood core underneath is exposed. No apparent damage to the black sidewall or edge, surprisingly.

Not super concerned about the cosmetics, fully aware that snowboards are meant to be ridden and will take bumps and scrapes in the name of having fun over time. 

My main concern is that I want to prevent any long term water damage to the wood core, which I assume means sealing the exposed area with some resin or epoxy. 

Should I take this in for a profession repair?

761,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

1109,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

1476,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

1863,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

Here are some great free YouTube channel resources for tips.

1901,1,"Hi,
So for a couple of years now, I've been struggling to find a board that suits me, there's always a trade-off with the last board I had before.

I don't ride park. I only ride in the French alps, so all my board needs to be able to do is carve, be quick edge to edge and moguls. 

Last year I bought a Bataleon Chaser 159, awesome on moguls and super quick to throw around edge to edge, but the carving capabilities were limited.

This year I got a Salomon dancehaul 152, great board overal. Carving and non bumpy slopes were awesome. But a real workout on moguls. 

Now this had me thinking. What board would be able to do both?

I was thinking a Bataleon Party Wave as it had the 3bt so I can throw it around while wide enough to be able to do some deep carves?

Does anyone know if this is a valid idea or any board that would suit both the carve and mogul slopes?

Thanks!! Carving-Mogul board?"

2294,1,"This thread is for riding tips and feedback requests. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 95% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. **Keep your weight stacked over your board.** Get low by bending your knees with upper body relatively upright, not by leaning over at the waist. Helpful cue is driving your shins into the top of your boot, and not just sticking your butt out. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OghfDJ9Gk_E).
2. **Weight more forward.** Most newer riders have too much weight over the back leg-- aim for roughly 60-40 front-rear weight distribution. Fore-aft weight distribution is more [dynamic and nuanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laidp3Afv68) than that, but 60-40 is a good starting rule of thumb.
3. **Shoulders in line with board.** Don't counter-rotate the upper body, keep shoulders in line with the board and the direction of the turn. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iofrv4rxJcY).
4. **Avoid edge catches.** Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVUnwWhz1x0).
5. **Ride more.** While practicing 1-4, and the occasional lesson or supervised session from a ripper friend never hurt anyone.

We havent had real snow where i live for a while, only getting some practice when we went up north. Made her our own hill and she did pretty well. 

I am assuming this board is good for slowing her down when needed, but after more research realized that nobody really uses these boards with holes.

I am wondering a couple things. Is it worth it to bring this board to a real hill to learn (bunny hills). Also, should these be waxed too?  Likely will get a proper board next year.

This is the first time ive set up a board on the burton est system.

First question  the toe piece on the binding slides in and out. The toe piece is all the way out is it too far out?!?!

Then the heel hangs over the heel edge far more than the toe over the front. Is that usual?

Im wanting a pretty beige set up im usually 15/-10 but befond that im trying to be pretty centeral on the board.

Also how tight for the screws!?!?! Im assuming hella tight???

2688,1,"This thread is for beginner and intermediate riding tips. Please submit video feedback requests here. Separate post videos are welcome on the subreddit  [/r/snowboardingnoobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboardingnoobs/).

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

Here are some great free YouTube resources for tips.

Note none of these are affiliated with this sub, they just put out consistently solid helpful content and are taught by solid to excellent rippers with strong instructing backgrounds. Some of these (especially Bennett) can trend a little more advanced, but all of them have some great beginner friendly content.

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

I‚Äôm traveling to Arapahoe Basin and Breckinridge during spring break and I was contemplating on buying my own gear after some crappy experiences recently renting.

I don‚Äôt know much about this board but it lines up well with my height. Any information anyone has on it would be great! 

Also, what would be good bindings that are relatively inexpensive compared to the market. This board definitely needs the beauty treatment. Nidecker Pro Pipe 55 viable?"

Trying to find out if this snowboard is real before I spend a few hundred bucks on it. 

I rented this snowboard from Blue Mountain and loved it so I‚Äôm trying to buy it new on eBay. 

The only difference I see between the one I rented, and the one that I want to buy, is that the barcode number is different. 

Anyone have any idea if that could mean it‚Äôs fake? I‚Äôm still pretty new to snowboarding so I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to tell. I would buy it from Burton directly but it seems like they don‚Äôt make it anymore.

The answer to 99% of feedback requests will be some combination of:

1. Bend your knees more
2. Don't break at the waist
3. Weight more forward, roughly 60-40 front-rear
4. Stop counterrotating the upper body and keep shoulders in line with board
5. Weight on the uphill edge, never the downhill edge
6. Ride more (while practicing 1-6)

The occasional lesson never hurt anyone either.

I'm going snowboarding in January and instead of renting I was thinking of taking my old board but I'm not sure if it is good enough or if it would ruin my experience because it's so old (about 14 years old).

Its appears to have lost most of its camber as well to untrained eye, with it being around 3-4 mm of the ground when laid flat. It's been a while since I paid attention to this stuff so I wasn't sure if that's acceptable?

A little bit about my experience/skill level in case that's relevant. I've been sbowboarsing around 5 or 6 times l, for a week each time, and I ride on piste primarily with a bit of off piste and pretty much never go in the park. I don't know if that makes a difference.

I'm mainly just wondering if my board is dead and needs replacing?

3799,1,"Tl;dr:  any reason I can‚Äôt use my ~1996 snow board for the slopes this week?  

I switched from skiing to snowboarding when I blew my ACL the first time in 1994 at age 16. I stopped snowboarding in about 2002 when I moved from the Rockies. Haven‚Äôt snowboarded since except once when I rented a board for a half day about four years ago. 

I‚Äôve only been skiing about ten times since 2002 with most of that in the past four years. 

I blew my ACL again earlier this year and had surgery again. I‚Äôm cleared for skiing/snowboarding. Leaving tomorrow to go for three days with kiddo. 

My board is a ~1997 WFO and I think it‚Äôs a 162cm.  If I get some wax on it, is there any reason I can‚Äôt use it?  (I have bought new boots since my old ones had actually disintegrated with age).

I‚Äôve received so many compliments and looks over the years as I sling my board up on my shoulder and carry it away with ease, all for a $5 strap from a bygone era of mandatory leashes.

4433,1,"Hi,

I have knock knees, basically my knees cave in and my arches collapse inward.

I tried skiing first for 2 seasons but I could never get to parallel skis and would get knee pain from poor form, so I switched to snowboarding which has been better on the knees/skills.

I‚Äôve been snowboarding for 3 seasons only about 3 days/season. I can safely make it down a moderate blue without issues usually. The biggest issue I run into is consistently carving without tiring out on steep terrain.

I work out lifting/stretching/cardio 4 days a week and always try to continue stretching for improved ankle mobility and strengthened hip flexors, but I‚Äôd say they are still not super strong even with all the hip/ankle exercises I‚Äôve followed for years.

Do you have any recommendations for snowboard adjustments with knock knees? I usually just have the rental place set my board for what they recommend/‚Äústandard‚Äù, but I‚Äôm wondering if any additional adjustments could help with easier carving related to the knock knees and weakish ankle/hip mobility?

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 170 lbs, ride with rental boards (whatever the shop recommends), and I think the knock knees is genetic bc my sisters have it too.

Thanks Knock knees and board adjustments"

These had a lack of reviews I assume from being a newer model so I was a little apprehensive at first, but to decided to send it and order them along with 3 other 3 finger mitts. These blew everything out of the water (gordini cirque 3 finger was a solid second place). Tried and true hestra leather with a waterproof layer. 5 finger insulation makes you feel like you‚Äôre still wearing normal gloves, except with the added warmth, mobility and padding for hard falls. Only drawback is price and sizing. I wear a 10 in all other hestra lines so I ordered these in 11 and they feel molded specifically to my hand.

The only clues I have are the names on the board (ignore the stickers):
-Ride Free
-Rave
-CC (not visible in the pic, but there is a little logo in a circle on the nose).

After years of blood, sweat, tears and sacrifices we had an opportunity to pitch to the Sharks on Shark Tank just a couple weeks ago. Guess what.. WE GOT A DEAL!

I was thinking of grabbing a Volkl RTM at 158cm or a Rossi Exp 76 at 162cm. My only concern is one may be too long for her or too short for me - but I may be overthinking.

I'm a pretty experienced skier, and I recently mounted a pair of nordica El chapos at 183 length. They're a pretty demanding ski.

When I took them into the trees and bumps with traditional forward leaning stance where you stand with minimal bend, I really struggled. 

When i got more centered and low by sticking my ass way out, but still focusing on having a forward lean, I found a lot more success, especially when it came to absorbing bumps and being able to get the skis around quickly without catching my tail edges. I also found this old thread on snowheads on the topic...

4932,0,"I have been skiing for 4 months now (\~30 ski days total). My current skis are 2022 Atomic X9 Wide Body 176cm, and measure 74.5mm underfoot. I am 193cm tall barefoot, and nearly 100kg naked.   
I ride in Atomic Hawx Prime 120S, but find them a bit soft and roomy now and plan to upgrade to Redster CS 130.  
I carve aggressively on blue trails and am usually by far the fastest person on the slope. I can do red trails and enjoy them if the snow is good, but usually they are more tiring then fun - in such cases, I am usually the slowest on reds, unless the snow is good.  
I find the most fun in dynamic, sharp, frequent turns at speed, while being fully in railroad mode. That's where I want to progress. Long carving turns at high speed used to be fun for me, but now I feel they are a bit boring and usually use up slope lengths way too fast to be enjoyable. I want to get better and usually ski 5-8 hours a day, oftentimes without breaks.

I started feeling my current skis are a bit lazy and sluggish at maneuvers. I don't know if it is because of them being wide, or X (which in Atomic lingo is a mix of G and S), or both. I would like something more dynamic, perhaps narrower and shorter, easier to maneuver at steep slopes, but still able to occasionally take them off the groomed surface to experience some off-piste.

What kind of ski would you recommend to me as my next pair? I was thinking about slalom skis, something like Atomic S9, or maybe the latest 2024 X9 RS which have been getting stellar reviews of late.  I do not really know other brands' lineups. Next skis advice - intermediate going advanced skier"

I am looking for location ideas for a Christmas ski trip for 2023. My family struggling to agree on a location. This year was Zermatt which was definitely expensive but amazing. Our plan is to go for a week\~ish (No more than 8-9 days) something like the 23rd-30th or 26th-3rd. As long as we are not flying on New Year's day. (We made that mistake last year).

Anywhere is on the table. (Bonus points for unique places with great views) We're aiming for a more budget experience this time around. There are 5 of us at all different levels. There is one snowboarder (me an advanced beginner), 2 beginner skiers, and 2 intermediate/advanced skiers. Only two of us will be needing to rent equipment. 

Our preferences are

1. Budget-friendly (ideally no more than 1200-1800pp for a hotel room, there will be two to a room except for one that has their own)
2. Snow heavy
3. Enough terrain levels for everyone
4. Apres Ski Heavy &amp; Great Restaurants (We're all 25+) 
5. Easy to get to from the airport by train or cheap hired car (Less than 2 hours is great but an hour or less is even more ideal)
6. Fun town to explore (without a car) if someone were to take a break from skiing.

Let me know if you guys have any recommendations. We would fly out of DC. Thanks Christmas 2023 Trip Ideas"

I flew from Orlando out to Denver and spent 4 days on Copper Mountain. The mountain got about 6"" of snow the afternoon/evening before, so the entire mountain was covered in gorgeous powder day 1 that survived in pockets through day 4. 

Day 1 I spent figuring out what I was capable of on my new skis on blues and some straightforward blacks. These skis glide over everything, I was able to bomb crud like I've never done! It was incredible!

Day 2 and 3 we spent on Three Bears lift off the backside tearing down blacks and double blacks. The powder back there was insane, and these skis floated on top so smoothly. I spent the afternoons running moguls off of Seirra and couldn't be more satisfied in how they turned in tight spaces (I'm 6'3"" rocking 181 cm skis)

Day 4 we spent in the park hitting the medium jumps and boxes (I'm not a huge park skier, but enjoy my times with the boys there). 

Overall, I'm just so excited that the skis did everything I wanted on any terrain, and I feel so lucky that I have another trip scheduled in less than two weeks!

I just can't contain my excitement and had to tell somebody, thanks for reading my rant haha Awesome time at Copper"

I knew my life was coming to a sad end when I decided to try once in my 32 years of existence what skiing feels like - due to the fact that I stay 2 hour drives away from some of the best ski places in the world. 

And somehow for a person who has never played a single sport in life, never done outdoor activities, never hiked, never liked the mountains and the snow. Skiing has changed my life. 

I guess it would be more fun if I can go with friends. But even when I am alone on the slopes, sitting on the chairlift, enjoying the ride, all I can think about is the wind in my face and the sound as I rush down the slopes. Skiing is what‚Äôs keeping me alive after 8 years of suffering through anxiety and depression."

Now that both are pretty much ridden into the ground I want to take a new approach and get a ski that works for everything. Deep days, park, piste, you name it. So I'm looking for something with a waist width of anywhere from 105 to 110. Since I want to finally learn how to do butters, something quite flexy and playful. I've been looking at the Line Sir Francis or the Movement Fly 105, but there must be more and I'm just looking for some recommendations for my next ski. I also want to get into touring, yet I'm not sur that would work well on a ski that should also be doing park so I'd appreciate any kind of advice on that too!

5252,0,"Dear Editors of Unofficial Networks,

I am writing to express my disdain over the use of the term ‚Äúf*t skis‚Äù in your publication. While I understand that this term has been used in the skiing community for many years, I believe that it is time for us to move away from it and use more appropriate language.

The use of the term ‚Äúf*t skis‚Äù to describe wider skis is derogatory and insensitive to those who may be overweight or obese. It reinforces negative stereotypes and contributes to a culture that shames people for their size. As a society, we should be moving towards more inclusive language and creating a more welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their size or body shape.

Furthermore, the term ‚Äúf*t skis‚Äù is not an accurate description of the equipment being used. Skis are not ‚Äúf*t‚Äù or ‚Äúthin,‚Äù. They are simply wider or narrower. Using terms like ‚Äúf*t skis‚Äù perpetuates a culture of shaming and objectification that has no place in the skiing community or in any other aspect of our lives.

As members of the skiing community, we should strive to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all skiers. This includes using language that is respectful and does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases. Instead of using the term ‚Äúf*t skis,‚Äù we can use more appropriate language, such as ‚Äúwide skis‚Äù or ‚Äúpowder skis,‚Äù to describe the equipment being used.

As members of the skiing community and as individuals, we have a responsibility to promote respect and inclusivity in all aspects of our lives. The use of inappropriate languages, such as ‚Äúfat skis‚Äù has no place in our community, and we should all work towards creating a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all skiers.

In conclusion, I urge the editors of Unofficial Networks to reconsider the use of the term ‚Äúf*t skis‚Äù in their publication and to use more appropriate and respectful language. By doing so, we can help create a more positive and inclusive skiing community that welcomes all individuals, regardless of their size or body shape.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Beth from Maine

Once I have tried 80-100cm ski's when I was unexpectedly in the Alps and had my ski's back far away at home. So instead of renting ski's I already have, I tried out all sorts. I found that the short ones were quite fun as well to ride.

But I really wonder about the pro's and con's that you find. I found I could still hold balance going about 80-100km/h downhill. They were a bit more twitchy, but really not too bad. Cornering was fine, carving, can't remember.

For those riding 80-100cm ski's in my length, how do you feel about them and why do you ride them? Anyone +/-175cm tall skiing with 80-100cm ski's?"

About me: Mid 40's, 40+ years skiing, Canadian Rockies, fav. skiing: fast carving, fav. ski: Rossi Hero Master

1. Has anyone used bindings with lateral heel release (kneebindings.com or Tyrolia Protector Series)? What was the performance like? Any unexpected releases with high pressure turns?

2.  For getting back on the snow post repair any experience with a ski designed to carve vs. a ski with a little more waist and skid?

Today I was on a 6 person lift (all singles so no one knew each other) and one guy was playing music out loud. I didn't mind, the other 4 people clearly minded though because they kept making all these passive aggressive comments.

One example was when the music would fade in between two songs, one guy would quietly say ""this is my favorite part"". Or the ski patrol guy who was on the end of the lift who kept saying ""this sucks"" but looking completely away while saying it. Just the lamest passive aggression I've ever seen. No one said ""hey man could you turn that off?"" or anything of the sort.

Finally after 3 songs the ski patrol guy looked at him and said ""yeah this music fuckin sucks"" and the guy didn't really know what to say, turns out he was European and kinda speaking broken english so I explained some people don't like the music, he got kinda sad and then the ride ended. 

Why all the lame passive aggressive comments?? What is up with that? Don't be a bully ok rant over Why are skiers so passive aggressive??"

The lift lines are usually a mess on this particular chair, the lifties kinda turn it into a free for all at times.

There is never a singles line and if there is it isn‚Äôt respected. On busy days the chairs don‚Äôt get packed and it‚Äôs annoying. 

That being said, I have made a habit of finding groups that are just 2-3 and will ask to join them. In turn it causes me to skip the four groups or even the 2-3 groups behind them. I do ask as I move up , try my best to be polite, and I‚Äôm not like rushing people‚Äôs backs but for the life of me I can‚Äôt let an unpacked chair go when the lines are massive.

5653,0,"Hey all, I fell hard yesterday with both of my bindings released, I noticed the toe piece on one of my skis is almost 60 degrees turned and a piece missing. Long story short patrol brought me a spare ski to get down.
The bindings are Look brand and came already installed on these beginner Rossi's (Experience 76).
According to the website they are warrantied for two years (I bought them a year and 2 days ago!) but I'm still in the process of getting a receipt from the store I bought them from(they erased all their records for some reason).
As they passed me around on the phone one lady sort of threw it out there that I can't even claim warranty because it's normal wear and tear. Is this true?
If I'm entitled to a part replacement under warranty, would that shop be responsible or should I go through Look's? I've moved far away from the shop, can a Look's dealer help me? The one in this ski town said it's too complicated for them to do and I have to contact Look's directly.

Thanks in advance for your help, I'm just trying to be informed as I try to fetch a pair of working skis before my next trip! (Renting a pair of Atomic Bent 100s right now and loving it!) binding broke"

5664,0,"This week is winter break so the mountain is filled with a lot of less Skilled people than a normal weekend.  I spendt the day at my ""local"" offpiste ski senter. The center only has one lift and 3 runs, but with a bit of hiking from the lift there is a LOT of offpiste options at every skill level. 

Since i know the terrain of the mountain i go straight for the good lines, but to my surprise i pretty much get the first line on all the good stuff. I arrived late today and it's a couple of days since last snowfall. And i see people starting to follow my tracks so i figure the people here today don't know the terrain. 

Before rounding the day off i go for one of the more challenging runs i know. It's a huge rock visible for everyone taking the lift up. The top part is icy and not easy to get down. As i reach the good snow it's starting to crack up as i step on it. So i don't full send it but follow the icy part further down before going for it. A lot of fun so i do it two more times.

But of course people follow my tracks. I have no problem with adults doing it they can make their own dumb decisions. But i saw parents with their kids following my tracks. I honestly felt bad for the kids.

The first i see was making their way down the side from the last return point by i got up again. Next daughter and father i see i yell from the distance to not go for it. Daughter hers it. i her The father say to the daughter ""but people have gone here"" when i leave i se more kids with a parent standing at the top of it. Not a single person did go there for the whole day until i did.

here is the the rock i am talking about. Yellow indicates above 31¬∞ https://i.imgur.com/DX0QVYD.png

And did I choose the wrong boot size? Should I size down even further with the Cochise? The boot fitter said I should be in a 28.5 (my feet are 28.8 when measured). I know that boot shells vary in size sometimes, but I've never had one be bigger when its supposed to be smaller. What do you all think? Weird boot shell sizing?"

5715,0,"I've been shopping for a new front side ski and am getting overwhelmed by all the options. I've noticed that a lot of skis that look like they might be good for both bumps and carving are on the softer side and rated for intermediate skiers. 

Now I've played my share of Gnar and everyone knows that I'm the best skier on the mountain, but I'm also past my prime and don't tend to ski super fast. So it got me thinking, why do i need a ski for ""advanced"" skiers, isn't it all just code for the ski's stiffness and ability to handle at speed? A mid soft ski should handle tight trees and bumps better without limiting me much for mid speed carving.

 Should i just ignore the skill rating while shopping, or am i missing something? Is the skier skill rating on a ski just code for stiffness?"

I'm 185cm and 190 pounds in weight. In terms of my skill I would say im late intermediate - early advanced. The ski sounds extremely interesting but i am hesitant since i have heard Bents are too sloppy for taller skiers.

&amp;#x200B;

My main focus and is backcountry and powder. If im at a resort i ski around 50/50 in and out of bounds trying to find fresh unskied lines. When im in bounds, i like to bomb down the groomers at maximum speed and smooth carves or play around with smaller jumps or bumps on the edges of the slope with my friends. Not really at all into park but might try a few features here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

I often like to strap my skis to a backpack and hike to ski random hills around my area with untouched fluffy powder so I'm looking for something floaty. I have no big mountains in my area so i have mostly questionable, slow terrain and tight, sketchy trees mixed by short charges down cliffs or pillows of powder. I think i need something fairly nimble and floaty in the pow yet sturdy enough to survive a charge on groomers for my size.

5886,0,"I'm just getting home from my first ski trip! Park City was such an amazing mountain, I just wish I had the right people to go with. 

Sorry, just a short rant here. I was one of 6 dudes on a trip to SLC/ Park City for the weekend. We did one of the all-star game events as well, and one of us lived in SLC, so we went to a few bars/clubs throughout. 

Myself and ""K"" were the only skiers of the group, everyone else snowboards. We knew the first day would be slow to start, as only two of us had bought lift passes ahead of time, and the night before was our longest night out, so we didn't get out til almost 11am.. then around 3pm (hour left of lifts), these dudes start talking about how tired they are and they wanna leave (we all rented a sprinter van for transport). 

Day 2, we all said that we would leave at 7:30 to get fresh tracks... myself and K were the only ones ready to leave come morning... we ended up not leaving til 9:45, then after 3... THREE RUNS.. the snowboarders saying they're tired and wanna get outta the mountain by 2 o'clock so we can go to a bar and watch the all-star game... 

The night of day 2, K and I discussed that we hadn't even gotten a single full day after 2 days of being there, and that we were gonna make sure and do whatever we could to get that full day, even if we had to Uber up before everyone else. I made sure before I went to bed, to pack everything perfectly so we could leave first thing and I could have a change of clothes to switch into (I would've left PC directly to the airport). Yet again... we had too much to take care of before we left (cleaning airbnb, returning others' rentals, returning the van), as we couldn't entrust the detail work to some of the others. 

I told the dude who lives in SLC the very first thing when I arrived for the trip; if there's 2 things I wanna do on this trip, it will hit McConkeys and Jupiter Peak... and we didn't even get to the Park City side of the damn mountain ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was with some great dudes, and we had a fun trip, so I couldn't lose my temper, but I came a ways and spent a lot of money only to get less than half of what I was expecting. The next trip I go on will definitely be with some more experienced people (possibly skiiers only) and with people who prioritize the snow over bars/clubs. 

The one saving grace was that I still have one day left on my Epic 3-day pass, and while it's a little bit of a drive, Steven's Pass is the closest mountain to me, and I'll be able to have a full day there. The only caveat is that I have to go solo.. I don't really have any ski friends here, let alone ones that have an epic pass or would be willing to make a 4-hour drive at 5 a.m. with less than a days notice üòÖüòÇ but I almost prefer that, as I won't be worried about taking anyone out of their comfort zone, and I won't have to be held up by anyone. If you're still here, thanks for listening.. if you have any tips for planning actual ski trips, I'd greatly appreciate it! 

TL:DR: I took a 3 day trip to SLC/ Park City over the weekend with random friends and in-total did less than 6 hours of skiing and missed a day. Now I have to drive 4-hours for a solo day at Steven's Pass.

5919,0,"Had a shop mount my skis (yeah I know that was my first mistake, I am on east coast for school not near my normal shop or patrol buddies that could do them)

They called and said heal piece failed on first ski and marker would warrantee. I went in to pickup and deal with marker on my own since I didn‚Äôt purchase these bindings at this shop. They said the heal spring was popping out and not staying in.

When I got home I noticed the one mounted ski was mounted incorrectly. They are marker kingpins and the heel piece was mounted while in walk mode not ski mode. The screws were put though the heel movement plate, meaning that they cant switch walk to ski mode and vice verso. The lever does not move. I removed the heal piece and identified that the screws were done incorrectly.

I removed the heel plate to fix this and discovered that the ski was drilled twice.

In addition to the above problems they mounted the bindings so they are at the smallest possible setting, instead of in the middle like they should be.

Shop was closed so I didn‚Äôt go back that night but headed in today. 

Regardless of if there is a problem with kingpins I think it is ridiculous that they drilled twice. They also did not tell me this, I found this on my own.

TLDR: Am I delusional to expect they replace with new skis? Shop botched bindings (yes I know I should have mounted myself)"

I'm an intermediate snowboarder on my 3rd season. I'm comfortable down any blue and have been progressing into getting comfortable going down blacks this season (more of a mental hurdle than anything; very confident in my technique - no lazy habits).

My girlfriend skis and is the same skill level. This season, we are planning on swapping one day; where I ski and she snowboards. I hear that learning to snowboard is harder than learning to ski, so she's definitely going to take a lesson.

I'm thinking that if I just watch tutorials on youtube, I can wing it as I don't expect to fall on my butt too often like I did learning to snowboard. I could pay for the lesson, but just want your guys' input on if you think it's really necessary given my snowboarding background lol. If you have any recommendations for youtubers or tutorials, please let me know as well! Does a snowboarder need a lesson?"

\+very good ski for the whole day on groomers, even in the afternoon you can charge through everything!

\+""3D radius"" is fun to ride, from long turns to nearly slalom ski turns

\-i dont like the smaller radius when leaning in very far. 

\-when skiing with friends, i take the reckoner 102

\-when skiing alone, i go with the K2 Disruption

\-only 1 day on those this year, and that was cause i packed the 122's instead of the 102's :D

K2 Disruption TI2:

\+my to go ski when skiing alone, and thats 80%+ of the time (why does nobody like groomers???)

\+perfect turn radius for me, i like it around 18-21m

\+still skis very good on softer piste or even on chopped  up piste!

\+fits exactly my riding style when im skiing alone! Go ham for 3-4 hours and drive back home!

\+had probably 30 days on those this season!

\-only for piste

\-when riding with friends, i need to ski to fast to really ride those skis and then im waiting most of the time and also i dont think its very polite when i'm skiing away from everybody lol

6182,0,"Picked up skiing this year and so far I really like it.  Problem is, I like snowboarding even more.  I‚Äôve been snowboarding all my life, and short of doing vids for Red Bull I feel pretty confident that I can get any job done in the trusty steed. 

I‚Äôve gotten good enough on skis to reliably get down any groomed piste with no issue.  But fuck me if I go off piste into some thick trees.  Whenever I do this my brain locks up.  Should I give it some more time?  At some point I feel like I‚Äôm going to have to choose one or the other.  I‚Äôd like to eventually be skilled enough to shoot down a chute or coulier without zig zagging.  I want to be able to send it for real. If I had to choose today I‚Äôd go with the snowboard because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm better at.  But when I‚Äôm in the groove on skis I‚Äôm really in the groove. And I love watching cliff jumping videos. 

Thoughts? Anyone both ski and snowboard?"

Trying to progress in my skiing, and am working my way into carving and moguls.  I have some wide (106 waist) powder skis that I use as my everyday ski.  I've read that wider skis tend to be harder to use for carving, and I wondered if this was also true for skiing moguls?

I know, I know - ""Just get better and you can carve and ski moguls in wide skis..."" I readily admit that I am an intermediate skier that has plenty of technique to improve, but I want to set myself up for success.

Thanks all!  Have a fun and safe rest of the season! Are wide/powder skis harder to use while skiing moguls?"

Been doing a mix of teaching myself and am fortunate enough to and occasionally ski with my coworker and their spouse who were ski instructor/ free ride coach at a major resort out west before moving to NY. Im decent at parallel turning on single blacks and double blacks but do tend to control my speed a lot, especially on the doubles, sometimes I stop turn down doubles as I‚Äôve only started trying them recently.

6252,0,"An algorithm for scoring in freestyle events. The formula values execution and style more of you spin more than 1800 degrees. 

In this formula, the ‚Äûmax‚Äú function is used to compare the difficulty and number of rotations. If the number of rotations is less than or equal to 1800 degrees, the formula reduces to the original version. However, if the number of rotations is greater than 1800 degrees, the difficulty is effectively divided by 9 to reduce its weight in the final score calculation. This ensures that tricks with more rotations require higher levels of technical execution and creativity to achieve a high score.  

The maximum score is still 100. you can adjust the weight of every factor, obviously. Rating = 40 * (0.2 * Difficulty + 0.3 * Technical Execution + 0.5 * Style and Creativity) / (max(Difficulty, Rotations/9) + 1)"

6285,0,"Hey! I‚Äôm looking for a slalom carving ski which will help me progress further into my instructor exams. Currently looking at master league/FIS SL skis, and I see that for men, all of them are at 165cm in length. I‚Äôm 185cm tall, or 6‚Äô1 for reference.

Currently carving on K2 Mindbender MTi‚Äôs @ 180cm. I find the GS feeling radius of 19.3m just a bit overwhelming, therefore looking to switch to a ski with a significantly smaller turn radius.

Would 165cm SL skis be too short for me? I don‚Äôt need a ski that fits FIS regulations, just a powerful, recreational tool. I‚Äôve seen some cheaper models which aren‚Äôt aimed at racing come in at 170cm as well. Skiing at 165cm just sounds ridiculously short to me.

6327,0,"I've been using a pair of Salomon S Max 10 for about 3/4 weeks of skis without ever sharpening them.

I finally bought the tools to sharpen the edges as skidding on ice/hard snow was becoming pretty annoying. 

So after those 3/4 weeks of skiing, the edges had accumulated some dents, nicks and some case hardened burrs here and there but no major damage. 

I first set up a 400 diamond stone (this is probably not coarse enough for 3/4 weeks un-maintained edges but that's the only grit I have) in my 87 file guide and made quite a few passes to smooth out the side edges and remove most of the burrs. 

Once done, I then started filing at 87 using [this file](https://www.tognar.com/medium-file-70mm/) that fits into [the guide I'm using](https://www.tognar.com/fk-multi-edge-tuning-tool/). Made a few passes with the file but I admit not really knowing when to stop so I stopped after the edge felt even smoother than before filing. I made sure to remove enough of the sidewall with a planner for the file to properly do its job. 

Finished with two passes of the 400 diamond stone, again in the guide at 87¬∞.

Yet, the skis barely felt any better on hard snow. A bit better but nothing crazy to the point where they were already skidding again after 4h of skiing. 

I probably don't have ALL the tools needed but the minimum I have should be able to give decent results right? 

What am I doing wrong here? What am I doing wrong with my sharpening process? I can't get my edges sharp."

6331,0,"Hello everyone! 

Just started skiing this season alongside my wife (she's been skiing in childhood and got back this season in order to initiate our 3 years old daughter) I'd say right now I'm on the lower scale of intermediate while she's on the upper scale. I've been searching for a one ski quiver. We're mostly going to ski with the kids on piste but we do want to be able to do some trees when we get some time for ourselves. We're not really looking for speed although it will be reconfortant to know that it is also pretty stable for when we get to ski by ourselves. Am I looking in the right direction with the Ripstick? Should we go 88 or 94/96? We live in Europe, not a lot of powder but we do get some days and if we progress quickly by chance get some time just for ourselves and venture into the forest it will be nice to have a bit of floating capability since some inches of powder will be there. Will the 94/96 be more demanding/ harder to progress on comsidering where we are right now?As for sizing I'm caught somewhere in the middle. I'm 5""6' (167-168 cm) 143 lbs (65 kg) strong legs, so I'm really struggling to decide between 164 cm and 172 cm. I want something that I can grow with and that I won't have to change really quick but also hoping it won't be overkill in order to be able to progress. She's really there with the height 5""1' (155 cm) 108 lbs (49 kg). But she said she wants something lightweight and short. I'm thinking that the 146 cm Ripstick might be too short for her and the 154 cm is just about right but I don't really want to get something that she will be uncomfortable on. For now we skied some rentals really stiff 74 width, mine were 160 cm at first and I struggled a bit with 167 cm after. Hers were 146 cm at first and she really liked them, then tried 156 cm and hated them mostly because they were too heavy. Any advice will be helpful.
Thanks! Ripstick 88 vs Ripstick 94/96 and sizing help"

She basically took that as ‚Äúgo skiing again in 2 weeks‚Äù and is trying to go 13 days after the event. She thinks because the pain went away when not doing anything its better‚Ä¶.
We have a trip booked a week later, and i think this is doable if she actually lets it fully recover.

She isnt able to take another fall imo without it getting way worse and potentially a chronic issue. I know it sucks but thats just life with injuries. They often feel better way before they are actually better.

I think if she gives it more time she could take a fall again and be ok, but definitely not going 13 days later.

Thoughts? I think she has never had injury before relating to any sport and is being reckless. My gf fell and injured herself. She is trying to ski again almost instantly. Is this appropriate?"

Lift 7 serves the beginner runs All Smiles and Takeoff which are both very easy greens and are perfect for a first timer/early beginner. 

  
Lift 3 serves the green runs Boomerang and the Zig Zag. Boomerang is accessed by getting off halfway and is the first run I would try on lift 3.  The zig zag is still relatively easy, but its the hardest green on the Valley side, it has couple of steep drops that I wouldn't do until you can do the other runs well.   


The blues on lift 3 are the switchback, twist, and double dip. I can do bottom 3rd of the switchback by getting off halfway and Its my favorite run so far. I tried the switchback from the top of the lift this time and the steep drops really scared me. I had to snow plough down the steep parts and fell a few times, but none the less I ""completed"" my first blue today. I still have yet to try the twist or the double dip as they look to be above my comfort zone. I really forced myself to go down the switchback today.  


Some additional information: I have skied 6 times now. Once at keystone, once at Breck, and now 4 times at loveland, once at the basin, three times at at valley. I just bought my first set of skiis, a used pair of Rossignol smash 7s 170.

6485,0,"I recently bought a multi-angle tool that goes from 85 to 90 by .5 degrees increment and it came with a [panzer file](https://www.snowcountry.fr/swix-t0108sb-file-milled-10cm.html).

Is this kind of file used to sharpen your skis once in a while (when touching the edges up with a diamond stone isn't enough to bring back the sharp edge anymore)?

I haven't been really happy with the edges I was left with after sharpening with the panzer. The edges were sharper than before that's for sure but not nearly as good as new. Should I use a file [like this one](https://www.sidecut.com/product/FL_WC_SIDE_15.html) instead? 

What's the proper material to use to get an edge as close to new as possible? What are panzer/radial files used for? Are they used for sharpening?"

6516,0,"Being brave by sharing this, hopefully to encourage other older non athletic dad bod office workers that play video games all day (used to play 3-4 hours of MOBA per day before I got hooked on this sport).

I‚Äôm 43 and was never athletically inclined. Didn‚Äôt know how to swim until 17. Always chosen last on every school pickup game. You get it. So I didn‚Äôt do anything outdoors or sports related since I went off to college. Again, I‚Äôm VERY awkward with my body, even things I could do like bike or run - when I saw any video of it, it looked bad. No joke, my wife asked me to skip the first dance at our wedding, and I gladly complied. I blame it on my scoliosis. 

Right before COVID, I had this epic vision that I could enjoy the mountains with my little boy and grow old together skiing. 

I thought I could take my 5yo son up to cruise down the green trail. Can‚Äôt be that hard. It‚Äôs like sledding, but on two sleds, right? Heh. Looking back at the old photos, I didn‚Äôt even wear a helmet. Jerry. I took the ride of shame. On a sled. 

After the pandemic, I started feeling really unhealthy and found out I had some problems. I needed to get healthy, and wanted something to do with my son as he grew older. So I went all in and took a few lessons last year to go down greens with my little boy. Got hooked and started reading books, watch videos, geek out on everything from gear to kids skiing and resort reviews. It‚Äôs weird, I‚Äôm very risk averse (I‚Äôm the guy driving up the mountain at 35 mph with blinkers on). But I kept doing dumb shit like going up a lift, enjoying the amazing views, and stumble my way to the bottom without knowing how to ski. 

Just 10 months ago, I was so happy I could pizza turn, but wanted fries so badly. After fries on the traverse, I wanted to stay french fries while turning. I wanted to gain confidence so I could get down most hills without the fear of God and patrol sleds. And bumps, who knows why I started getting obsessed with moguls without even knowing how to do a short turn. 

I put together some clips of my learning journey over the past year, mostly this season. Didn‚Äôt know what it felt to get out of the backseat until 5 days ago. 

Damn. It felt good. 

Don‚Äôt quit, it‚Äôs worth it. If I can do it, literally anyone can. Thanks for listening to my TED talk and the cliche soundtrack I paid $1.99 for the rights to use on Apple Music. 

Much love to this community, and the ski patrol guy who saved me from myself at Sierra-at-Tahoe. Never too late to learn"
6517,0,"I've been thinking about new skis. ON3P has always stuck in my head ever since I heard of the brand, and now that I have money it's hard not to look at them. 

Unfortunately, I live in the Midwest, I usually get out west once a year. I've been looking at the Jeffery 102s, I want to keep all mountain performance, but I like to hit jumps and want to get better in that respect. Most of my time on the local hills is spent messing around with friends, so I'm looking for a playful ski. 

I'd say I'm a strong intermediate skier, but I'm worried I won't be able to use the ski to their full potential. 

I currently ride 172 Volkl Bash 86s. Am I dumb for wanting ON3Ps?"

**Some options I'm looking at:**

* Marmot Refuge (tried on at a store and it seemed nice. Sleeves possibly a bit long, and not sure I want a wrist gaiter) 
* Outdoor Research Carbide (seems good, although some reviews complain the hem is too tight)
* Outdoor Research Hemispheres (gore-tex, which is nice. Side zippers seem unnecessary) 
* Stio Environ

A few people asked about Heavenly for beginners, especially first time visitors staying or starting their trip in the village/gondola that encountered the tiring walks and confusing routes back to lodges. 

Here‚Äôs a sketch of my recent experience and suggested paths. This resort is so big and complicated for first time visitors. But doing laps on Tamarack Lift can be boring and uninspiring. So here‚Äôs my suggestions for seeing more of the mountain and doing laps on greens in CA and flat wide groomed trails in NV.

All of the blue trails that I pathed are ‚Äúeasier blues‚Äù. The blue trails on the paths suggested on these maps - are for skiers who can pizza down greens, snowplow to stop, or riders that can walk or falling leaf to control speed. 

Getting back to the Gondola:

Once you‚Äôve had fun with CA and NV way home can be a bit tiring. Nothing super hard, but for green beginners, it might mean a lot of slow turns down. Second photo shows the way out. Might be worth it just to get the beautiful, long, easy flat Skyline Trail experience. If you do take the Sky Express, and you want another scenic, longer early-intermediate run, you can go down Ridge Run and go back up again. 

The easy way out from CA is taking the lift or tram download from the top of Patsy‚Äôs lift to the CA Lodge, then taking the free shuttle bus back to the Village Gondola. I‚Äôve done this. No shame. Just don‚Äôt take the Gunbarrel RUN, take the CHAIR.

6834,0,"As an advanced skier trying to up my technique, I think that I will need new footbeds (and will see a bootfitter about this).

My question is, how many people use them and find they are helpful?

In my case I am trying to feel pressure shift from heel to forefoot as I initiate a turn and the interface between the sole of my foot and the boot does not seem to be making a lot of contact. I just don't seem to be able to manipulate my foot pressure very well. I do have a high arch and maybe this is partly why.

Also on this note: Any thoughts on off the shelf inserts versus custom? The customs can get quite expensive. I imagine that if I am lucky I could find a premade insert that happened to fit me well, but if not the custom would be far superior. Custom footbeds: How many people have them?"

Me and a few friends are skiing for the week in first week of March at a few resorts in CO: 2 days at Breck, a day each at Vail, Keystone, and A Basin.

 - Should I be concerned about getting adjusted to the altitude? I‚Äôve skied in Utah but from what I‚Äôve seen CO is way higher.

 - What‚Äôs the drive like between Denver and the resorts? I assume I‚Äôll need a rental car with snow tires but do they rent those out at the rental car places at DEN airport?

7002,0,"In the recent posts there has been some people voicing their concerns (valid or not) about consumption of alcohol or drugs on the slopes. 

Does anyone have experience with drug use while skiing? What did you take? How was it? Did you feel like a danger to yourself or others?

I‚Äôll start : I was 17, night skiing at a small station close by. Went with a friend who brought along what he called a ""weed pen"". Thinking it would be just like smoking a joint, I took a couple of puffs and went down the mountain. Turns out it was a WAX pen. For those who don‚Äôt know, wax is a weed concentrate that is wayyy stronger than regular weed. Halfway down the slope I was starting to get really high, but not enough for me to stop skiing. Going down seemed to be really easy now, and I felt everything differently. It felt like dancing with my skis, the wind and the snow. Luckily the station was almost empty. I had so much fun that night, but only because my friend and i were almost alone in the station. I wanted to go on and on and my friend had to force me to go inside and heat myself up since my face was starting to freeze. I ate the best poutine of my life that night between the cold, the hunger and the munchies.

Lesson learned: That was a fairly bad idea, but I had fun.

TL;DR: I did wax on the slopes while thinking it was weed. Ended up really high, with a big smile and a belly full of poutine.

I called the ski school and told them what I have skied because I wasn't sure if I should book advanced or expert level. They recommended expert, but told me they would watch and switch to advanced if that's what I needed. 

I haven't had a lesson since I was a kid. But even with a \~15 year break from skiing, I was skiing down the Cirque Traverse at Snowbird after 2 days. I know my technique was probably not great, but I made it down with minimal trouble several times.

At Jackson Hole, I want to work on hucking cliffs, steeps, and couloirs. Start small on each and work my way up if I am able. I am not sure if any of those would even be covered in a group class? That's why I was thinking private lesson so I could ask to focus on those things and also get my technique corrected as well.

Any thoughts on which I should pick? And which to do first if I end up doing both? Group or private lesson?"

7100,0,"22M here, never skied in my life since my family was rich enough to go nor did my parents skiied as well.

Some hindsight, I have been ice skating for over a decade. So that played to my advantage. I didn‚Äôt have a ski instructor, if anything I just followed my friend whom didn‚Äôt do much teaching other than make me watch how he moves.

First hour I was on the kiddie hills learning how to do the basic stuff. Then I got on the ski lift and began practicing on the greens. I fell a lot! But didn‚Äôt get injuried except a slight bruise. By the end of the night, I was able to do parallel turns and stops on either side to a decent level. Skiing became fun once the training was done!

Quite curious if it‚Äôs normal to be ok at skiing the first day without an instructor? My friend was telling me I picked it up faster than him and he was doing black diamonds that day First Time Skiing, So Much Fun!"

7120,0,"I was skiing at Mt. Baker, WA two weekends ago, enjoying a lovely weekend with my family when an incident caused my life to flash before my eyes.

Backstory: I am in my 40s now and don‚Äôt do much of the crazy stuff anymore. Most of my time is spent on the groomers with my young kids these days. Sometimes I get an hour to shred by myself towards the end of the day as the kids wear out, which is when this incident occurred.

In short, I was skiing fast but in a straight line down to an wide open area where three different chairlifts begin. The area is fairly open and flat, and there‚Äôs no one in front of me. Next thing I know, there‚Äôs a huge thud and I‚Äôm sliding on the ground with no skis on. When I stop, I look up and there is a snowboarder 30 feet down from me. He is face down in the snow and not moving. I mean, he‚Äôs not moving whatsoever. There‚Äôs a lot of commotion from people on all the lifts who witnessed it. I quickly get my wits about me and run down to help. He‚Äôs definitely not wearing a helmet and definitely unconscious. He has a few friends who catch up and are trying to help as well. 

In the end, he woke up 10 seconds later, bloody mouth, stupified but ok. Ski patrol shows up and we fill out incident reports, blah blah blah.

Now that everyone is ok, I look at my skis and notice that my brand new bindings have a snapped heel lever. This guy basically broadsided me at stupid speed, so much so that the front edge of his board snapped this metal lever. A few inches to my left and we are both in the hospital.

I was mentally messed up the rest of the day and my ski day was certainly over, but grateful we were both ok.

Now that time has passed, I‚Äôm selfishly more pissed off than anything else. I‚Äôm assuming this isn‚Äôt repairable. Is it possible to buy one binding? I only have 5 days on these ones.

PSA: Look in front of you, and for crying out loud, wear a helmet! Almost died from a collision. But I didn‚Äôt, so is this repairable?"

I primarily ski park on the east coast, but want an all mountain ski as I love the woods whenever the east coast has the snow for them. ON3P recommends a 181cm for my height (5‚Äô9.5‚Äù) but that seems very long for what I‚Äôm used to. With the huge rocker on the Jeffrey 102 ski, does anyone recommend I size up to a 176cm for ON3P, or should I stick to the 171cm to be tight in the trees for when I want it?

One thing to note is the 171cm all play I ski now has an effective edge of 1370mm. The Jeffrey 102 in 171cm has an effective edge of 1355mm, versus the 176cm with an effective edge of 1400mm.

Final note, I already ordered the 171cm Jeffrey 102 ski, I would need to return it to get the longer ski. While I do want this to be a long term ski that properly fits, if the hassle of returning it for 5 more cm in length isn‚Äôt worth it then please be honest. Thank you ON3P ski length comparison"

I can‚Äôt find any information on temperature rating, which will help me decide what size to keep. The medium fits well, and would allow me to wear a base layer and maybe a thin fleece, but the large will let me wear thicker and more layers. 

Any advice on the jacket/how it should be fitting? I get hot quickly when I‚Äôm moving, but do get cold if I‚Äôm stationary or slow haha.

It seems like the connection from brain to leg is just not there to do the left turn. She can turn right consistently but refuses to gain and speed because she can‚Äôt make the left turns. She has to pick up her leg and plant it back down to make a left turn. 

We have gotten her lessons but the instructors have been stumped as to why she can‚Äôt do it because everything else looks fluid.

7206,0,"For context, I've been skiing the last 7 years, and I got into park skiing about 3 years ago, and I tend to spend 60% of my time on skis in the terrain park, but ever since this season began, my mindset just isn't there, and I've been absolutely terrified of doing almost anything, even easy stuff I've been able to do for a while like 180s and 360's, and the more time I spend in the park, and the more I try and push through the fear, the worse the fear gets, and the more annoyed I get at myself. In short, the more I do something, even if I know I can do it, the more afraid I am of it. I tried taking some time off from the terrain park and just ski some powder and do some carving for a few weeks, and come back to it fresh, but as soon as I went back into the park, the fear and the dread was even worse. My progression is basically zero by this point, and I'm actually struggling to get to the level I was at this time last year. By this point I'd honestly like to quit but I know that would end up making me even more miserable than I am now. I was wondering if anybody else on here might have gone through the same thing, and if there's anything I could do to ease the dread and the fear, and help me to actually enjoy freestyle skiing again? Cheers. Why is my fear getting worse?"

I just got the skis and the pair of shift bindings. I'm mainly skiing inbounds but this year I'm starting touring as well. For now, it would be 70/30 (inbound/touring). I'd say I'm a fairly aggressive skier, but I also do quite a few flowy, smooth runs.

Even if¬† I would not be¬†out touring, I tend to ski a lot of resort off-piste and woods. I like to drop small cliffs, throw in a grab, nothing gnarly. Also,¬†I'd like to start learning 180s and 360s this season.¬†

Now with all these being said, where would you recommend I mount the shifts?

7239,0,"A few years back I worked as a ski instructor for a season in Austria. I'd mostly have groups of children which was a lot of fun but obviously more work. 

Usually private lessons are for a day or so... but this time I got booked for an entire week which is exciting because you get to see their progression. I was booked by a rich Austrian guy in his 50s for his Brazilian boyfriend in his 30s who had just seen snow for the first time that week. I'd teach the Brazilian throughout the week while the Austrian guy skied the mountain and checked in on us every once in a while. The three of us would always eat lunch together which they offered to pay for (though I made sure to only eat lunch places where ski instructors would eat for free anyway). 

The guy made really good progression despite often struggling with his weight distribution. He really enjoyed the week and ensured me that it wouldn't be his last time skiing. At the end of the week I got my biggest tip of the season. The Austrian guy handed me ‚Ç¨50 while the Brazilian guy handed me a very nicely rolled joint I smoked later that evening with some friends on a balcony looking over the mountains.

I was a bit stiff and my range of motion wasn't exactly ideal. I could do some simple maneuvers, but I was not rippin' anything higher-level than an easy blue. I do some powerlifting a couple of times a week since last year. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I do work out. That's what surprised me about yesterday; my joints were not prepared, and I was pretty stiff. My legs were basically straight the entire time because holding a bent position was painful. How can I loosen up for later this month? I felt like a bit of a wimp, only going down greens. I usually ski once or twice per year, so I know what I'm doing a little bit, but my knees have never hurt this bad. Are there any stretches that can help my legs become more limber and have an increased range of motion? I'd like to make this next trip the best yet.

I am reposting my comment to another post asking if a Craigslist post offering half off lift and equipment rentals was real.  

Here‚Äôs my story from last month:

I was scammed from a similar post on Facebook. I‚Äôm new to skiing so I believed he was selling using his employee discount. I bought a 3 day lift ticket, which worked! So I proceeded to get the discounted lessons (they were usually 1000 but I paid 600). I got confirmation emails from Vail so it seemed legit. I got my lessons. Thought all was good.

1.	‚Å†I paid using Venmo (with purchase protection, luckily).
2.	‚Å†I got a phone call from Vail Resorts a few days after I got home saying, your card was declined.
3.	‚Å†I checked my Epic account and someone else‚Äôs name and card # (last four digits) were there.
4.	‚Å†I reported this incident to Vail but they seemed to not care about the context. They only wanted the payment. They ended up charging my own debit card by looking it up from my lessons two months ago.
5.	‚Å†They never charged me for the lift tickets (it was my sons name, so I assume the scammer just made an account so they couldn‚Äôt track me down).
6.	‚Å†I took all screen shots and disputed on Venmo. I got most of my money back, but I still ended up paying to Vail at full price (minus lift tickets).

Lesson: they are running a credit card scam. I consider myself generally safe and paranoid (hence convincing this guy to let me use protection). Look up ‚ÄúSteamboat ski credit card fraud‚Äù and you will see this was a known issue a few years ago. I found it while researching.

7386,0,"Ive been snowboarding for three years, every weekend. My dad died from covid about a year back, he left me a brand new pair of Salomon QST 99's that he never got to rjde. My dad was about 5'10 and around 250lbs. 

Anyway, the skis are 181cm long, which I am worried might be a little bit too long for me, being 5'9.5"" and around 190lbs. So I might end up taking then to my local shop and exchanging them.

Mounted to the skis are the Marker Griffon bindings he used on his previous skis, I will probably end up keeping these. 

I anticipate my riding style on skis to match my style on my board, lots of off piste terrain and a bit of carving too. 

I fully intend on riding my snowboard until my body no longer allows me to do so, I just think it would be cool to learn both sports.

Will the skis my dad left for me work, or should I swap them? Also, I would appreciate any pro tips and advice that would be specific to a relatively advanced snowboarder switching to skis.

If this is of any relevance, my home resort is Timberline on Mt Hood, Oregon.

Cheers! Snowboarder considering picking up my late father's skis...HELP."

Can you tell your experiences with this French village/ski resort? It's on my shortlist for next winter but still am in doubt about it. One source says queues for the lifts are quite alright, others say they are slow and outdated (like Armera lift) and there's a huge waiting time at these. How busy is this area actually? I'm going with New Years week.

When I look at the slope map, one can cross the entire area with only green and blue runs. I'm a beginner (1w experience and 11h lessons before that, will take another 10h before next winter) and can't do red ones. But I read a lot of these blue runs are actually red (like Combe Orsiere) due to inclination, narrowness and icyness. Hope someone can tell about them.

Any other information would be appreciated. Because on paper this ski resort is perfect it's just the noise I hear about it that makes me nervous. Valloire / Galibier-Thabor"

7428,0,"Hi all.

Brand new here and brand new to skiing. Never snowboarded either, or really seen or been around lots of snow that doesn‚Äôt melt as soon as it hits the ground. Im actually posting this post-first day of skiing and I‚Äôm mainly doing so for advice for tomorrow (my 2nd and last day). I started at 8 am with my friends and we went until about 4 pm, with a lunch break in between. They‚Äôve all skied and snowboarded before, but they took me up to this ‚Äúbunny hill‚Äù where I got to practice for a bit. But then they encouraged me to go do some green trails. I did about 7-8 runs today, but I fell about 15 times, two of which were pretty bad. It takes me a while to get down because I‚Äôm too timid to go fast. I mostly do J(?) turns on the downslopes so I can maintain my speed, and each time I do it, I‚Äôm wedging my skis into the mountain pretty hard. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I dove head first in a bit too quick though. It‚Äôs been so much fun, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt nervous 90% of the time. Mainly being around other people who are actively avoiding me, and I them. Because I‚Äôm so new, I feel as if my movements are unpredictable and that poses a danger to myself and others. It went very well today though. Both of my crashes were due to just getting tripped up &amp; going too fast. 

Should I spend more time on the bunny hill tomorrow, or should I continue trialing by fire? I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs my last day and it needs to be spent on the learning hill, but I‚Äôm just looking for experienced advice here. 

Thanks! Skiing for the first time in my life in Keystone, CO - I‚Äôm 30."

7506,0,"Exactly what the title says, has anyone noticed marked improvements from picking up skating (either figure skating or hockey) alongside skiing? I live hours from the mountains and took a hiatus from skiing for a couple years. During that time, due to a disability I had to stay near restrooms....so I took up figure skating! I'm not great, but I've kept it up and keep going on weekdays, far more often than I'm able to drive out to the mountains. 

Since returning to skiing, I've noticed it's helped me improve at: 

* maintaining balance more easily
* stronger thigh muscles
* upper/lower body separation while turning
* keeping my head up and looking farther down the hill toward the direction I'm going, rather than right in front of me
* turning the ankles more to properly activate edges
* being able to skate properly on flat land (always sucked at this) Anyone else notice that ice skating helps improve your skiing, and vice versa?"

7513,0,"Background: I used to ski a lot as a kid/teen/early 20s, fearless and unbreakable idiot, but last year was my first year back in over 15 years (and now I'm an old, breakable, wuss). I'm finding the head game part of the comeback way more difficult than the actual skiing-- my body remembers how, my brain is a scaredy cat. 

ANYways, today I had a really bad crash (and my first crash since I started skiing again). 

I was on a pretty easy green in the learning area, minding my own business and working on some mellow drills on the side of the run. I'm super OCD about other skiers (because wuss), and I knew there was someone about halfway up the run, and a couple instructors off to the other side (no class, just the instructors), but that was  it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was super in control, doing shorter turns (working on my one leg/downhill leg-carving drills), when all of a sudden, I hear a woman yelling in panic from behind me, and half a second later, before I could even register, she rammed into me going full, out of control, speed. Obviously, we both went flying. I hit super hard, garage sale'd all over the hill, and got the wind knocked out of me pretty good. I'm pretty banged up/feel like I was hit by a truck, but it could have been a lot worse (thanks, helmet).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already such a ""fear in my head"" skier right now who has such a huge distrust of other skiers, I'm nervous this will set my progress back a lot. As it is, I'm the dork waiting at the top of the run until it's as clear as possible/I'll wait if there's someone whose ability I don't trust heading down the mountain.

&amp;#x200B;

SO: Any mind tricks to getting over the big crashes-- especially the ones caused by other skiers/boarders where you couldn't possibly have prevented them?  I didn't keep going today (it was going to be one of my last runs anyways), but I know next week I'm going to be irrationally afraid of all other humans. Getting over yourself after a big crash"

I have been reading about the Duke PTs since I would also like to do some occasional resort uphilling as well and these seem like they will fit the bill for what I am looking to get out of this new set of skis. 

Two questions:
1. Are there issues with my plan overall?Should I be considering other skis/bindings instead? Anyone have this same combo and love or hate it?

2. The Dukes come in a 100 and 125 width. Reading online it seems like the 100s should bend enough to accommodate the 106s. Is this accurate? Has anyone done something similar and had success or failures?

7624,0,"So in the past few seasons, I‚Äôve had intense pain in my upper thighs, even after only a few runs. I‚Äôve taken multiple lessons, even one private, to see if my technique was wrong, and most of the time it wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not in the backseat normally unless it‚Äôs really steep or deep powder. 

One person suggested shorter skis, so I took their advice. No help. Even got ski blades and that seemed to help some but then it came back with a vengeance the past few days at Steamboat. I will say the powder here was nuts and visibility was low so I may have been more defensive than normal. 

I‚Äôm in decent shape, could afford to lose some weight. But when I‚Äôm not skiing, I do Orangetheory three days a week so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs being out of shape. 

Curious if anyone else has had this issue. When I read articles or watch videos online, they mostly say it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in the backseat but according to multiple instructors, that‚Äôs not usually the case. Why am I still getting Upper Thigh Burn?"

Note that I'm not racing, I just bought those skis because I wanted something agressive and because they felt very good when I got to try them a week ago. 

I guess the more often the better (without wearing the edges off too much) if my goal is to have a good grip but what would be a good compromise between grip on hard snow and sharpening frequency for this kind of skis? How often should I sharpen my skis for hard snow?"

The instructor asked if I‚Äôd done a ‚Äòdrop in‚Äô before, to which I replied no (I assumed he meant a small jump and then into a slope) and after he explained what he meant, I was confident of my assumption. 

I followed his tracks and after going off the jump, was surprised to see the ground about 2-3 metres below me, at which point I realised that what we were undertaking had been lost in translation. 

Face planted, cartwheeled two or three times and got up without pain, although I did notice some discomfort on my head (luckily I was wearing a helmet). Almost instantly I felt nauseous, spaced out and a little tired so I assumed I was mildly concussed, as I‚Äôve suffered severe ones before playing sport. 

Went to local medical centre and saw a doctor who said on a scale of 1-10 it‚Äôs basically a zero in terms of severity. I‚Äôm no longer nauseous or tired after having some food, although still a little spaced out with a background bit of a headache (was perfectly fine to drive though).

7702,0, Today I had the most incredible introduction to off-piste skiing. Shout-out to all the talented friends willing to teach.
7703,0,"Hey everyone! Have any of you ever been hurt and had to be transported down the hill in toboggan? How about also the ski patroller losing control and then detaching from the ski patroller while your strapped in to the toboggan? This recently happened to my sister. She said it was the most terrifying thing she has experienced at 22 years old because she was strapped in flying down the mountain. She managed to get her hands free and began trying to slow herself down, luckily missing trees, skiers and lift towers and everything else. Between her free hands, lessening terrain, heroic people trying to stop her, she only mildly crashed into the ski racks at the bottom. Really no injuries that we know of as of now. We feel like we are so lucky! I should mention the ski patroller went down a blue run instead of taking the mellow green, there was no need to to add additional risk and there was only one patroller attached to the toboggan, no others assisting. The mountain has apologized but I feel like my sister should at least get a free season pass ( or lifetime) out of it for her terror. Im writing as a big brother because i saw how scared she was afterward and think its shitty the mtn is just trying to cover their ass. How would you go about asking for this? Ever been lose from ski patrol in a Toboggan?"

7711,0,"Hi,  
I'm planning a group skiing trip to Japan for two weeks (one for sightseeing, one skiing), around this time next year. For the skiing part, we're leaning towards Niseko (not a dealbreaker, but it ticks all the boxes) and trying to find accommodation around there.  
The kicker is that we expect to have a group of 30-40, and ideally find somewhere that won't break the bank - the plan was that we could find some hostel and book a couple dorm rooms. I've had some difficulty trying to find up-to-date info on hostels, lodges and hotels around Niseko, and am a little worried that some places have quietly shut down post-covid.    
  
I think the max cost per person per night would be around 13k JPY, and so far we've found a couple places that could work:   
Heritage Lodge, Stoked Hostel, Owashi Lodge, SlowLife Niseko and Niseko Moiwa Lodge. The first three are in Hirafu, which is preferable, but not necessary.   
  
TLDR: Does anyone have any recommendations on affordable hostels for 30-40 people, ideally in Niseko or otherwise somewhere in Hokkaido?  
  
Also, does anyone have any recommendations for transport around Tokyo/ New Chitose Airport with ski bags and luggage? (Considering taking the train vs bus from NCA to Niseko) Advice on accommodation in Niseko, Japan"

7713,0,"Obviously once you see them skiing you can easily tell who is who, but
my friends and I have noticed that Jerrys and park rats have very similar styles on the mountain 

First off, they are the two groups on the mountain least likely to be wearing a helmet. Then they‚Äôre either wearing a brightly colored full matching suit or baggy oversized non-waterproof clothes. And they both like to ski without poles. All this adds up to them being easily mistaken for each other at first glance Anyone else like to play the game Jerry or Park Rat while they‚Äôre skiing?"

7720,0,"I personally find that hand scanning tickets is just about the least efficient use of man power a ski resort.   


It also backs up the line on less than crowded days because you have to wait for the ticket scanner to come check your ticket, versus in gates you can almost always by pass the people who either scanned and didnt go though or put their pass next to something.  


Also my home resort tend to block the line down to one line so the scanners can keep up, this mean you are stuck behind people who can not move on skis...  


It also feel quite aggressive for someone to come and point something at you.   


Overall I think I work at the only resort than had RFID gates and went back to hand scanner and I think it might have been the most short sighted move that was done.

My husband really wanted to go to Alta so I obliged. We both typically stick to blues and don‚Äôt do the crazy stuff. No tree runs, major moguls, or super steeps. On occasion, I‚Äôll do black diamonds if it‚Äôs a large enough wide bowl. I‚Äôm sure Alta is fantastic but I‚Äôm honestly concerned about being just intermediate at such a big deal resort and if I‚Äôll even enjoy myself. 

Which runs/lifts should we stick with there as intermediate skiers? Are the blues more difficult than your typical blues (we‚Äôve skiied Deer Valley, Breck, Whistler, Tahoe, Flagstaff, and Copper Mtn. 

Any tips/tricks are appreciated! Thank you! Alta Ski Resort 1st time tips for intermediate skiers."

- Never trust other ski tracks when going off piste

- Don't go skiing alone in super deep pow (you might actually not get up if you fall)

- If your guts tell you to don't ski a line - then don't. Especially if there's an avalanche risk

- Everybody is on a hill to enjoy themselves - don't be an ass or a gatekeeper even if you think they're major jerry's.

7878,0,"My friend just started skiing and wants to pick up a pair of skis so he doesn't have to rent every time he goes. He's 6'2. The ski shop recommended skis that are 160 to 170. To me, that sounds way too short, at least the 160s. But I have no idea. I haven't been a beginner since I was 4 years old. So thoughts? 

Also, what is a good ski for beginners? I figured since he's tall and heavier, not fat just 6'2, an intermediate ski might be a better choice. But again, I have no idea. Beginner skis for someone 6'2"""

7896,0," I'm someone who takes lessons quite frequently, and am always looking to get the most bang for my buck. So what has been your favorite and least favorite lesson experience? Here's my answer:

Favorite: Back when I lived in the area, I took a private lesson at Deer Valley (no, not on my dime lol) and lucked out being paired with the woman in charge of the program. Probably the most in depth, informative lesson I've ever had! Still have the notes on my phone to this day. Even though I've outgrown the notes, it feels like a waste to delete them in case they might be useful to friends or family!

Least favorite: Got a group half-day lesson at Kirkwood. Weirdly, the skill categories were completely mislabeled on the website. Not a big deal, as they sort you into the correct group anyway. Well, they spent the entire first hour simply getting us to the correct instructor. And despite there being a cap of 4, they gave the instructor 6 of us. A manager dumped us on him, so the poor instructor didn't have much say in it. The guy barely got a chance to observe each person individually, and the only advice he offered me was ""get on your edges more"" with just about no further instruction. Total waste of money.

**So what has been your best and worst experience with lessons? Any ""red flags"" (or green flags) for instructors when taking one? How often do you take them? Do you find better results with private vs group lessons, or is the cost not worth it? Or do you mostly shirk lessons in favor of other tools like CARV or free Youtube videos?** Let's talk about lessons!"

Basically I have really old Voelkl 724‚Äôs from 2005/2006 that were gifted to me from my older brother, and have used them ever since. I only go skiing about once or twice a year, but I have been tasked with teaching my niece and nephew how to ski (next year), so I would like to be able to ski backwards while I teach. I am able to ski backwards from a skill standpoint from hockey/skiing on certain very small runs, but have fallen due to hitting a larger snowdrift while going backwards. Many of the double tips I see on the slopes look generally quite large/cumbersome, and I like doing glades which require tight turns and agility. Looking for ones that might be similar to what I currently have. Thanks in advance!!!

In terms of length, my current skis are 172, so would probably like to keep them close to that/under 180. 5‚Äô8, 190lbs for reference. Non-Park double tip skis"

I‚Äôm looking to get the park detune and softer flex at 171 through custom but idk if it‚Äôs worth it and how much detune it is. Or is the Mango already soft enough where I wouldn‚Äôt need the soft flex for butters etc. Would the detune heavily hinder my on-piste skiing? I don‚Äôt carve much. 

How long would the Mango last in the park. Wondering if going custom is money well spent or if it‚Äôll go bad in a short time. If so, then i‚Äôll probably just pick up cheaper skis for dedicated park.

And would it be worth it to center mount it, or stick to the -2 mount. How does the Mango 110 do in park?"

But now I watched this video where this lady does kind of the opposite (forces the turn by twisting the ankles in the direction she wants to go).

I have been snowboarding for 15ish years and last season I tried skiing for a day or two and my first reaction was ""this makes so much more sense!!"". I had no problem going down a black on my first day, although not very gracefully and with a bad technique 

I want to explore the backcountry on skis and decided to invest few weeks this season to get better.

This is a video after two weeks of skiing in a group where the instructor filmed us doing small turns and then carving. The only feedback he gave me was to relax my arms a bit. However, I feel there's a lot more things going wrong - like my knees being all over the place, so I decided to post here and ask for advice :)

The main things I'm thinking of while skiing is weight forward on my shins and upper body facing down. As soon as I think of something else, one of the above goes :D

I can confidently and, as I think, pretty quickly find my way down the mountain. On good days 50km/per day. I dont go off-piste very often but hills can sometimes get kinda rough after lunch.

*Currently I am looking at following skis:*

**Head Supershape E-Magnum** 177; 14,3m (129-72-111) 500‚Ç¨

**Atomic Redster Q4** 177; 16m (125-77-109) 350‚Ç¨

**Rossignol Experience 82 Ti** 184, 17m (127-82-115) 515‚Ç¨

Looking for some folks that are local/near to Seattle area that would like to do some days this winter to take some photos. I've got experience shooting a lot of skateboarding and aim to take photos that show the people and the moments of the sport as much as the sport itself. I'm looking to just practice and take some shots of folks skiing doing tricks, carving turns, dropping cliffs, having a good time, etc.

Here are some example of my [skateboard photography on imgur.](https://imgur.com/a/7G257Ow) For a broader look at my overall style, you can find me on Instagram @ notflintmichigan

Personally I come from a long ski background and am comfortable on the snow, in the air, etc. and have only recently picked up photography in the last few years.

**This is not for any sort of self promotion on my end,** though if you're looking to promote your own skiing we can work something out. It's merely to start building my experience and knowledge with shooting something I know so intimately.

I am due to take 70-odd students on a ski trip to Pal-Arinsal in February with other staff from my school. Although we are able to go off skiing ourselves whilst the kids go off with instructors it would be good to be ensure we can stay in contact if anything went wrong.

I believe that Andorra is not classed as part of the EU so roaming is not included in normal phone contracts. Is it close enough to France or Spain to pick up their networks or will we have to suck it up with respect to joining Andorran networks and probably pay through the nose for the access?

8343,0,"I skied alta last weekend since everyone on this sub loves it, but really it was a mixed bag. Here are a few know before you go.

Pros:
- Good mix of beginner through advanced terrain. 

- food was good for the price

- the snow was great

Cons:

- no expert terrain: I‚Äôm an advanced skier, and after skiing a double black diamond at Vail, I think I‚Äôm close to an expert. But Alta has no double black diamonds! So I wasn‚Äôt able to ski expert terrain, and unfortunately I‚Äôm still an advanced skier. If you‚Äôre looking to become an expert skier, alta is not for you!

- Unfriendly skiers: i got yelled at multiple times by people, never have I experienced such a rude group of skiers. The first time I was listening to some music on the chair lift, and someone asked me to turn it down! I told them that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear it otherwise, and they told me to use headphones. They made a noise when I told them it wasn‚Äôt safe. Rude! Anyways I switched the song to mean by Taylor swift, so I think I had the last laugh. In another incident, they had just opened up the devils castle area and I was the third skier in line. The views were amazing, so I stopped to take some pictures, and the people behind me yelled at me to get moving. I asked them if they couldn‚Äôt enjoy the views and they said no, they just wanted to ski. Eventually they just went below me, and ruined the skiing by making another traverse.

- poor signage: I went past one sign with an exclamation point in the cecret chutes area and after skiing some nice snow, found myself on the edge of a cliff. Thankfully there were some skiers behind me, who showed me a way down. But it was just a really narrow strip of snow surrounded by rocks! They told me to point my skis straight so I followed their advice and pointed them straight across the snow strip and side stepped down the thing. The whole time they were yelling at me ‚Äúno point them straight, you‚Äôre ruining it!‚Äù Which was confusing since I did exactly what they told me. More examples of rude skiers.


Anyways, contrary to popular belief on this sub, alta is not for most people. If you‚Äôre looking for expert terrain and nice skiers, don‚Äôt waste your precious days at alta. Try solitude or snowbasin instead.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. Know before you go: Alta"

Me:

- 6' / 165lbs / 33 yrs 
- I'd say advanced skier, but not really sure how to gauge this.  I raced on the East Coast throughout my teens and have been comfortable on any marked run I've been on, both in the east and west.  Only been a handful of days in the past couple years, but still very comfortable.
- My current skis are still my ~15yo race skis (Volkl P60 SC/GC WC).  This is one of the reasons I'm having so much trouble is that I've never shopped for an all-mountain ski, I've just made do.
- I enjoy skiing wherever the snow is the best.  If there's fresh snow in the bumps or woods, I'll be there, otherwise groomers work.


Options (based on current availability at Evo):

- Salomon QST 92
- Line Blade Optic 96
- Nordica Unleashed 98 (or 108)
- Nordica Enforcer 104 Free
- Salomon QST Blank (112s)

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a difference with the equipment. I have put on 8kg since I last skied which might make a difference? I just feel so entirely out of control on blue (intermediate) runs. I feel like when I put pressure on my downhill ski I sort of lean away from it and my balance is thrown off and I have no control. I struggle to keep my skis close together as well when making my parallel turns although I can move them in a parallel way, they‚Äôre just not close. I feel like this is mostly a balance issue? I‚Äôm also scared of gaining too much speed and am constantly trying to slow myself down. Maybe skiing just isn‚Äôt for me anymore?

On beginner runs I feel fine, but even so my technique feels off. I‚Äôm hyper aware of my body which might mean I overthink it a lot and I hate feeling out of control.

2) If not, should I go for the longer work-surface (120cm instead of 95 cm)? My skis go up to \~190 and I'm worried that the shorter table will mean I'll have trouble apply pressure on the edges when tuning.

I have always put the inner elastic liner of ski pants above or (space allowing) inside the boot, while the outer lining goes outside. Never had problems, seriously. 

My wife and apparently all of Reddit agree that the liner is ""supposed"" to also go outside the boot to act as a seal. This makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is: why does the outer layer exist at all then? It seems like it was designed to have an inside and outside layer. If the intent was just to make a seal at the bottom outside the boot, why do you need two layers for that? One layer with an elastic bottom would work just fine. 

To be clear: I have already conceded that putting the elastic layer on the outside is better, I'm just not convinced that's how it was designed to work. Settle an argument"

Wife is a beginner, maybe just into intermediate territory. Our home mountain is Bogus Basin, where she can handle just about any of the blues, albeit with a bit of struggle on steeper portions, depending on the day. 

I am somewhere between advanced and expert, usually spending my time that I‚Äôm not with her seeking out double black bowls, glades, shoots, or anything with untouched powder. 

I was looking at Seattle Ridge, as it looks like there is the most beginner terrain there, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty steep by the standards she might be used to (Bogus is fairly mild-rated in terms of difficulty). I was also thinking maybe she might enjoy some of the longer runs as well (College, Olympic Lane?)

For me, I was thinking I‚Äôd check out the bowls off Mayday as well as the Sunrise area off Seattle Ridge. 

I also figured we might be able to to take Mayday up together, she could head down Bowl Lane/Broadway while I hit some bowls then meet back up at the bottom of the lift. 

Maybe I‚Äôm completely off-base though. Like I said, never been and we want to make the most of our time there. Would really appreciate any thoughts you all have! Wife and I are heading to Sun Valley for the first time - hoping to get some advice to make the most of it!"

8876,0,"Hello reddit skiers, I recently agreed to go skiing after a 10 or so year hiatus. I used to ski through elementary and high school but back then even the school wouldn't require helmets.   


I've learned since how important they are by riding horses. My head is size 59 (59 1/4?). Equestrian helmets are very precise especially expensive ones so you can get by number 57,58 , 1/2 / 1/4 ect.  


I just rush/guessed since everywhere is sold out and bough an Oakley Mod3 MIPS Helmet. I got both M and L figuring I could return one. The Medium is SNUG. I dont think it will give me a headache but my eyebrows defiantly move with it and headshaking doesn't phase it. The large feels BIG on the other hand. I really have to tighten it down and then it feels OK. If I wear a beanie under it its good but I read you should take padding out if so? TBH none of them feel right but I dont have time to change. Maybe I should hold off and shop around? I really want to be safe evn though ill be doing easy stuff you and learning the basics you never know Helmet Fit Question ASAP"

Currently, my plan is to complete OEC at a local east coast hill. I'd then either volunteer there next winter, or try to move out west and volunteer/do paid patrol.

My concern is that ski areas out west might prefer or require EMT vice OEC. So I don't want to spent 150+ hours on OEC only to need to get an EMT cert down the line. Is this valid? Do ski areas in Colorado tend to require EMT and not accept OEC? 

Is it even possible to get an EMT cert specifically to become a ski patroller, or is it only for fire/EMS? 

Thanks! Appreciate all advice. OEC vs EMT for Ski Patrol"

8919,0,"So, today on the slopes I was pretty rude, maybe even aggressively called out by an instructor for cutting his class.

Now I totally understand that cutting a class is really annoying for them. It can lead to dangerous situations and especially with multiple students can simply be annoying. Do note that this was most likely a private class as there was just 1 student.

So let me try to explain the situation best I can. We we‚Äôre on an (EU) red slope, not crazy fast but can get pretty speedie if you try. It was a pretty narrow slope, big enough for multiple people next to each other, but a little more narrow than usual.

The instructor and student we‚Äôre using the whole slope, making long slow turns all the way from side to side, sorta annoying for others but not unusual or anything. 

So I was skiing towards them and had planned on passing behind them as I normally always do. Now for some reason, whether he made a small mistake or whatever the distance between the student and instructor became a lot bigger, resulting in them both being on completely opposite ends on the slope. 

Passing behind the student was no longer possible as there was no space there, and stopping with my speed and the distance between them was simply not possible.

Now I know it‚Äôs uphill‚Äôs responsibility to account for any possible mistakes happening downhill. And as such I went out of my way to take the middle of the slope, plenty far from both but yeah, I did ‚Äúcut‚Äù his class.

After getting down from the slope the instructor came to me to call me out for cutting his class. He didn‚Äôt listen to what I had to say as there was literally nothing I could do in my eyes. 

Am I really the bad guy here? Should I handled it differently? 

I get it‚Äôs hard to judge from just writing, so if you have any further question please feel free to ask. I‚Äôm just trying to improve. 

Thanks! Honest opinion on this situation in the slopes"

I'm about 5'8 and 135 pounds, so im pretty light for my height. 

I also like skis a little on the softer side, and I herd Jeff's were really stiff so im not sure what I should be going with. I know mango's are park skis but I heard mango's flex was a bit softer. I could go the custom route for a jeff and get soft flex but i'm not sure if thats good or not.

Lessons are done and I've got a few days more, should I just continue like this? I seemed to have skipped snow plow and gone straight to parallel"

Pretty sure the lady tightened wrong my ski and it couldn't let go as it should have (I also had difficulty taking it off before the fall, had to apply a lot of strength for that)

So now, 4yrs after surgery, I got the option to go skiing for a day w my school. I really wanna go because it's snowing a lot lately and I liked that one day before destroying my knee, but I'm hella scared. Any useful tips on how to ski safely and loose my fear? Thx Tips please"
9016,0,"Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm an anxious 25F. I‚Äôve gone skiing a couple times when I was younger (12 &amp; 14) and was able to pick it up and enjoy it. 
The last few years I‚Äôve tried snowboarding a couple times and failed so hard i couldn‚Äôt enjoy it. I hit my head really hard the last time and felt sick after lol. 

I have a ski trip with friends coming up in 2 weeks. Since I last snowboarded a couple years ago I have gotten into better shape physically and just generally more active. 
I‚Äôm going to give skiing another try but I‚Äôm very nervous. I can‚Äôt afford lessons but have friends that are instructors and my partner that has skied his whole life that will help me when we‚Äôre there. 
 I‚Äôve been watching lessons on YouTube but was thinking of how I can start preparing physically for it. 

Would getting some rollerskates help get my body used to a similar motion? Any other tips for prepping before I‚Äôm on the mountain?

9024,0,"I was skiing this weekend and I had my skis locked to a rack. I've had a family member get his ski's stolen once, so I always lock them up. They were also BRAND NEW skis... this was legit DAY 1 on them.

It was the end of the day and I was with a she-ski program. We went into the ski school building to do some wrap-up stuff and I came out and the rack, along with my skis, had been dragged to the side of the building. The 15+ other pairs of skis on the rack had been dropped on the ground right where the rack was. I think mountain maintenance moves the rack for grooming purposes, but there's no way they were going to groom when there was a pile of other peoples' skis still there.

They completely destroyed my lock and scratched up my brand new skis. The resort apologized, but they'll only pay for the damage done to my lock and not for the skis. The damage was ""only"" cosmetic according to them, but they've lost a lot of resale value and I bought last season's version of the ski specifically for the graphics and they look like crap now.

I'm still pretty upset and want some sort of compensation for the skis. Do you think that's fair? Am I Entitled to Compensation for Ski Damage?"

I'm a beginner skier that's progressing pretty quickly. I've been skiing for about 1-2 months (\~14-18 days under my belt). I can comfortably ski blacks at Winter Park, Copper, and Eldora (Colorado) and starting to work on double blacks.

How do I know what type of skier I am (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3)? I like to ski trees, moguls, and side hits. According to my Garmin, I max out around 30 mph and average between 10-15 mph. I tried asking the person at REI when I brought my skis in to get tuned, and they weren't helpful...

They have had parental support and privilege to achieve their goals. For those of you who started late when this was their dream, how do you overcome the immature jealousy you may feel? Do you think these kids know HOW lucky they are they got this type of life?

I never come to the internet to vent but as this is a mostly anon place, I felt I could put myself out there. I‚Äôve been indirectly complimented this season about how good I am at skiing even though I‚Äôve been doing it only for about a year total given the break between seasons etc, but I‚Äôll never get to do what I wanted due to my age and fear of permanent injury to my body.

9164,0,Hey y‚Äôall. About to try skiing for the first time and I‚Äôm super nervous. I went snowboarding last year and fell a lot and I even think I got a hairline fracture in my arm. I know they say you fall a lot less skiing but I need some peace of mind. I will be doing a full day lesson but I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôm not gonna know how to stop and end up in some trouble. Any tips or words to calm me down? I just want to enjoy the trip fully and take full advantage of skiing while I‚Äôm there. All advice is greatly appreciated! :) 4 day ski trip: first time skiing

9180,0,"Found an awesome deal on a set of used 4FRNT Hojis (believe it's a reverse camber). Have been skiing Volkl Kendos (more traditional camber profile I think) for the past \~5yrs. 

Took the Hoji's out for the first time today, and WOW. It's amazing how easy it is to get through a mogul field with these things. Even on wide, groomed flats, was flying down the hill because I felt more in control of the skis (ie. more confident in making turns whenever I wanted)

So just now realizing... just how big a difference ski design can make. And now realizing why folks go down the rabbit hole of piling up a collection of skis lol!

Question for the ski gurus here... the mogul performance on the Hojis is due to the reverse camber? Or is it from the lower rigidity? When I bought the Kendos way back, I picked them based on a combination of reviews/ratings, top sheet design and cost. ie. I didn't really know what I was doing. But it not like they're bad skis right? Had been reasonably happy with them so far. Is it more an issue of skill level? ie. I mostly go down blacks, but wouldn't really call myself a great skier New (to me) skis and suddenly I can ski moguls!"

9262,0,"Bound to be some of you that have some good thoughts or experiences on the topic and I'm curious to hear about them.  Specifically from skiers that may be on prescriptions that include stimulants.  

I was recently prescribed a stimulant med for mine and have read all sorts of different opinions re: whether to discontinue taking them on ski days vs. not.  For example my Dr. cautioned against it in scenarios where I may be likely to experience altitude related symptoms.  She said stimulant meds can sometimes exacerbate those and trigger other issues.   

I could see it either helping to maintain focus (increasing safety) or possibly making you a little over confident leading you to put yourself in situations you might not have otherwise (dangerous terrain, skiing recklessly in crowded areas?).  

And if you choose not to take it while skiing, how do you manage withdrawal if say you're on a multi-day trip?  Seems like that might make you pretty groggy and uncomfortable in its own right. To the ADHD/ADD Skiers Here: Curious If You Continue Medication on Ski Days or Not"

Today I made my way onto some runs that had some deep, but tracked out pow.

I ended up just bombing down for the most part, but I feel like there's got to be a better way. Felt very difficult to turn the skis when the tracks were up to a couple feet deep and powder felt sticky/heavy.

Just felt like I gathered speed *very* quick, but wasn't having much success doing short turns and surfing over the tracked stuff.

I don't think it's a ski width thing but maybe it is? I have 100 underfoot and they were floating beautifully on fresh/untracked stuff.

9453,0,"Wanted to get people's take on an experience I had last week.

So I consider myself I pretty advanced skier like many of you all here, and I primarily ski at Kirkwood. For those of you who don't know, Kirkwood is at least in the running for the most advanced mountain in the Tahoe area. There is a lot a very advanced big mountain terrain, and the most iconic of this is the north face of the cirque which connect to Thimble Peak called ""The Wall"", accessed from Chair 10, pictured [here](https://live.staticflickr.com/2325/2278201579_db0f801677_b.jpg). 

Most of the face is actually not that extreme... definitely doable for any sufficiently advanced yet casual skier. It's really mostly the very top along the ridge line which is truly extreme, meaning that any possible way down from the lift necessarily starts with some proper expert-level double-black terrain for at least a hundred feet or so. That being said, there is typically a small cat-track which is both cut into the mountain and groomed around the front of the lift, which you can see in the link above if you look closely. This is the route probably 90% of people who ride chair 10 take to start their run. It still starts off very steep and sketchy, and also has a habit of getting bumped up and icy, but it is significantly easier than the alternative. 

What is the alternative? The alternative is to ride a small cat-track which runs the ridgeline above the face. From here, the only options are some pretty extremely spooky and ballsy drops off of some cornices, or down some couloirs, which look like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ae7jafDeaig/maxresdefault.jpg) or [this](http://snowbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KW_Heart_Chute_above.jpg). I don't care who you are. That's some serious shit. Like I have done all of them, but I'm not gonna lie, they are some fucking spooky lines that definitely come with some pucker-factor. 

Now, naturally, Chair 10 is ""Experts Only"", and has a warning sign to that effect at the bottom. However, most people who are regulars at Kirkwood know what is up top. 90% of people know that they can take the cat-track around the bottom of the chair and start from there, avoiding the need for a cornice or couloir drop. 

Well, I was skiing there last week, and I had spent the day skiing with my girlfriend (a less advanced skier) mostly doing stuff off of Chair 6. Towards the end of the day, I wanted to get at least one run in off of chair 10, so we split off for a few runs and I went and did that. 

As I took the chair up, I got to the top, and I immediately noticed something I was not prepared for. The cat-track was unplowed, the snow cat was sitting there completely buried in the snow, and patrol had that whole route completely blocked off. This meant that the only way down from Chair 10 that day, was to drop off the ridge. 

There was no additional signage at the bottom, no warnings from lifties... nothing out of the usual. The result is you had a bunch of people at the top of Chair 10, who had taken the chair under the assumption they could do what they always do, which is taking the cat track, who were now all congregated at the top of the ridge looking down and shitting their pants. 

Even though this wasn't a big deal for me, I didn't think I was signing up for that either. It was the end of the day. I was sore. I was tired. Freefalling off the lip of a cornice into tracked out bumps 30 feet below and tanking that impact was not exactly on the top of my list of things I wanted to be doing at that point in the day. 

There were maybe like 10 or so people crowded around my particular line of choice, and maybe 10 or so others here and there all standing on the edge looking down. Eventually I was like ""well... this line here doesn't look THAT bad. Should I be the guinea pig?"" and then everyone just kind of looked at me. Then I went ""well... dropping..."" and sent it. People had been taking that line previously, so it was super packed, fast, and bumped, and I was manhandled by the impact, tucking my knees to my chest, and screaming out the bottom to a stop. 

One person followed soon after me, getting about the same treatment, and the rest continued to stand up there looking down as we skied away. 

Now... what is your take on this? 

Is it irresponsible for the mountain ops to sort of bait and switch people who expect the easier way down to be available, only to find that only the insane ways down are available? Or, do you think the ""Experts Only"" sign at the bottom means ""*EXPERTS* Only"" and people should be expected to be able to take alternative ways down when the easiest is not available? 

I mean you could argue you could always just take the lift down, but let's be real, no one wants to be that guy, and everyone is gonna feel some sort of pressure to ski it even if they are not comfortable with it and did not intend on it. 

I see patrol taking people down on sleds from those drops all time. It's dangerous shit. I just feel like mountain ops is just asking for people to get hurt in situations like that. Like at least put an extra disclaimer at the bottom, right?

Thoughts? The ""Experts Only"" Bait and Switch - Irresponsible?"

* Ski the Hidden Valley off laguzoi
* Do the Sella Ronda
* Make it over and ski the Marmolada Glacier

For logistics. I know I can take the gondola up in San Vigilio and then down the piculin run, then take the bus (20ish mins) to the Sponata lift at Alta Badia and then ski to the other places (except Laguzoi which needs another bus).

I assume I would need 3 separate days to do all of these things?

I'm assuming I can ski over to the Sella Ronda and do it in a day, but getting back to the bus will be tight.

Skiing over to the bus to Laguzoi should be reasonable to do in a day, but how long would it take to ski over, take the bus and ski the Hidden Valley?

Is skiing all the way over to Marmolada and getting back for the bus reasonable? How long would it take to ski to the glacier?

How easy is it to get a taxi if I miss the bus back? Would it be worth taking a taxi over to Marmolada? (how much do taxis run?) I'm also looking into a rental car to see if my Italian friend can drive (although not counting on it).

9541,0,"I started snowboarding in my 20s, would go a few times a year. I got pretty decent. My peak achievement was being able to do a 180 off small jumps. Then in my 30s, I switched over to skiing. Now I'm 41 and my kids are finally old enough to do it with me, so this year is the first year I've gone skiing in a while. We have been 3 days this year and I remember how much fun it is.

But reading this subreddit and watching youtube videos about skiing technique, it just seems so dang technical. It makes it seem like you need perfect posture, balance, etc to do it. I took a 2 hour group lesson earlier this week and the instructor told me so many things I should improve on. But honestly, I have plenty of fun going down the mountain with my kids even with my shit technique.

When talking to the instructor, he made it sound like the point of skiing (for him) was to just go as fast as you can down the mountain. Get as many runs in as possible while expending the least amount of energy. And I think that's what a lot of comments/posts on this subreddit allude to as well. Is that true for most skiers? And that's why they want the best technique so they can go as fast as possible?

For me, the fun is doing turns and small jumps and trying to learn how to ski backwards and do ground spins. I also just love being out there with my kids. I don't have any desire to go ultra fast down the steepest runs. I also like to get tired. I want to feel my muscles get sore. I want the exercise.

I am going to rent some of these short skis (ski boards) because it seems like it will let me do spins and rollerblade moves (I also love rollerblading) out on the slopes, easier than with my long skis. Seems to fit in exactly with what I enjoy about skiing.

Is this just not a common way people enjoy skiing? Why the extreme focus on speed and perfect technique? why is skiing so technical? is there a place for someone who just wants to have fun and not go ultra fast?"

9553,0,"My poor wife got disoriented and skied slightly off track, going over forward in the soft snow, rear binding releasing but still getting a badly strained calf muscle. 

Eventually ski patrol showed up, no skidoo available so she was stretchered down.  After skiing in Australia and US we were not expecting the ride down to be chargeable, and so pricey.  Medical centre bills etc yes, ski patrol no.  Given we‚Äôd gone about 50m on our first run, it‚Äôs been our most expensive day per metre skied ever. 

Just another thing to be aware of in Austria.  Neither of us are very keen to return, which is such a shame as everything else has been *so* great.

She had a cast for 6 weeks. Since last year she has been so hesitant and do not come with us to ski( despite she has always been interested in skiing and almost obsessed with it).

9573,0,"I've been learning skiing with my kids and my oldest loves it but the young one (3) just doesn't do the drills properly. I can't tell for sure but I'm pretty confident hes not putting most of his weight on his outside ski, amongst other basic things. He can barely navigate a lift maze, much less get on the lift by himself. I assumed he would go pro some day but now I am just not sure. What do you suggest? I bought him short skis so it would be easier for him to carve but he keeps doing wedge turns no matter how much I lecture. I taught him pole taps and he enjoys that but he refuses to send it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously, at what age is it beneficial to impress these skills on youngsters? Obviously the top priorities are to have fun, be safe, keep warm, and have quality time with the kids. Should I just let them develop habits however they want until they ask for advice? Or is there anything important to correct now before they develop habits that are hard to break when they are older? I don't have any hopes of pressuring them to do more than they want, but don't want them to struggle unnecessarily. My toddler is learning skiing but I fear he's just not cut out for it"

I can be balanced on the ski and mostly go in a straight line (while feeling actually wildly off balance and like I‚Äôm not at all in control and about to fall over on the wrong side) or feel balanced in terms of weight distribution (skis and all) and the ski will turn all on its own to the inside, quickly unbalancing me.  Am I completely missing something essential here? Or could this be a boot fitting issue?

For context and background, I generally have excellent balance, better than most anyone else I know. Not trying to brag, just trying to provide context as to why the trouble with this drill feels so confusing‚Ä¶

As for ski ability, I‚Äôm not sure what makes someone an advanced vs expert skiier, but I can usually ski anything inbounds and have a good time. But I‚Äôd still like to improve and expand my abilities and tip and steering control.
